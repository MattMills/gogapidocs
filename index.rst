Welcome the Unofficial GOG API Documentation!
=============================================

A community created documentation of the APIs used by the GOG website and
Galaxy client with the main intention of promoting a native linux client. It's
a very young project, so don't be surprised if something is missing.

The only open source implementation right now is
`pygogapi <https://github.com/Yepoleb/pygogapi>`_.
